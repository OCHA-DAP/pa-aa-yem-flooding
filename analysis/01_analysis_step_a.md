# Notebook title

Include a 1-2 sentence description of what the analysis in this
notebook is trying to accomplish.Throughout the notebook,
try to break up the code into meaningful chunks that are annotated
throughout with descriptive text.

For the most part, notebooks should only contain function
implementation, rather than definition.Code that you reuse
throughout or across notebooks can be refactored into functions
that live in a `utils.py` file that sits in the same directory.

The name of this file can be changed to include a meaningful 1-3 word
summary of the analysis - eg. `01_process_glofas.md`.

```python
%load_ext jupyter_black
```

```python
# Start coding!
```
